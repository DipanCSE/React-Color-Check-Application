🎨 Color Checker App

A simple and interactive React app that allows users to input color names or hex codes and instantly see the color displayed! Adjust the text color for better visibility and experiment with endless color combinations.  

🚀 Features:
  - **Dynamic Color Display**: Visualize the color you input in real-time.  
  - **Hex Code Conversion**: Automatically convert color names to hex values.  
  - **Light/Dark Text Toggle**: Switch between light and dark text for better contrast against the displayed color.  
  -**User-Friendly Interface**: Minimalistic design for seamless interaction.  

 🛠️ Tech Stack:
  - **React**: Built with React for fast and interactive UI updates.  
  - **CSS**: Styled with simple yet effective CSS for a clean look.  
  - **Hooks**: State management made easy with React hooks like `useState`.

📂 Project Structure:
```
src/
│
├── App.js           // Main component rendering Square and Input
├── Square.js        // Displays the color and adjusts text visibility
├── Input.js         // Handles user input and color management
└── index.css        // Basic styling
```

🎯 How It Works:
  1. **Input a Color**: Enter a color name (e.g., `blue`) or hex code (e.g., `#3498db`) in the input field.  
  2. **Dynamic Updates**: Watch the background of the display box update in real-time.  
  3. **Toggle Text Color**: Adjust the text color between light and dark to ensure it stands out against the background.
